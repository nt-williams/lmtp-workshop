<p>For our first example, we’ll use a synthetic dataset of <span class="math inline">\(n = 1000\)</span> patients from a hypothetical clinical trial for a treatment to decrease intubation and death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The data is based on a database of over 1,500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital prior to 15 May 2020 with COVID-19 confirmed through PCR.</p></li>
<li><p>To replicate a two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT), we’ve simulated a hypothetical treatment variable (<code>A</code>) that is randomly assigned for each observation with probability 0.5.</p></li>
<li><p>The outcome of interest (<code>event</code>) is intubation or death by 15-days post-hospitalization.</p></li>
<li><p>Treatment is associated with increased survival.</p></li>
<li><p>Baseline covariates include: age, sex, BMI, smoking status, whether the patient required supplemental oxygen within 3 hours of presenting to the emergency department, number of comorbidities, number of relevant symptoms, presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, dyspnea, and hypertension.</p></li>

<p>Our goal is to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of the hypothetical treatment on intubation or death:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\theta &amp;= \E(Y^{A=1} - Y^{A=0}) \\
&amp;= \textcolor{blue}{\E(Y^{A=1})} - \textcolor{red}{\E(Y^{A=0})}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the ATE is composed of two parameters:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the proportion of patients who receive intubation or die in a hypothetical world where all patients receive treatment (<span class="math inline">\(\textcolor{blue}{\E(Y^{A=1})}\)</span>), and</p></li>
<li><p>the proportion of patients who receive intubation or die in a hypothetical world where no patients receive treatment (<span class="math inline">\(\textcolor{red}{\E(Y^{A=0})}\)</span>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We refer to these parameters as <em>population mean outcomes.</em> Let’s rewrite the target parameter as a function of interventions using the framework we previously discussed. Let <span class="math inline">\(\dd_1(a, h) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dd_0(a, h) = 0\)</span>. Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\theta = \textcolor{blue}{\E(Y^{\dd_1})} - \textcolor{red}{\E(Y^{\dd_0})}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Remember, we refer to these interventions as static because they return the same value regardless of their input.</p>

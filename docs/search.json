(Most papers we read assume this!!) While assuming exposure variables are binary can simplify the definition of causal effects, many exposures of interest in reality are not binary.\nInstead, we will work in situations where \\(A\\) is a binary, categorical, multivariate, or continuous variable!\nIn the previous section, we defined \\(\\dd(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon_t)\\) as a function that maps \\(A_t\\), \\(H_t\\), and potentially a randomizer \\(\\epsilon_t\\) to a new value of \\(A_t\\). Our focus henceforth is estimating the causal effect of an intervention, characterized by \\(\\dd\\) on the outcome \\(Y\\), through the causal parameter\n\\[\n\\theta = \\E[Y^{\\bar A^{\\dd}}]\\text{,}\n\\]\nwhere \\(Y^{\\bar A^{\\dd}}\\) is the counterfactual outcome in a world, where possibly contrary to fact, each entry of \\(\\bar{A} = (A_1, \\ldots, A_\\tau)\\) was modified according to the function \\(\\dd\\).\nBut what is this function \\(\\dd\\), how can it be defined, and how does using this function to define interventions solve the problem?

    "text": "Modified Treatment Policies\nWhile much attention is given to static and dynamic interventions, their use is often accompanied by a few key problems.\n\nDefining causal effects in terms of hypothetical interventions where treatment is applied to all units may be inconceivable. For example, we may be interested to know if reducing surgery time reduces surgical complications. However, it‚Äôs inconceivable to set all surgeries to a given duration, even if this duration depends on patient covariates.\nDefining causal effects in terms of hypothetical interventions where treatment is applied to all units may induce positivity violations.\n\nA solution to these problems is to instead define causal effects using modified treatment policies (MTP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìö Definition\n\n\n\nModified treatment policy: An intervention characterized by a hypothetical world where the natural value of treatment is modified is called a modified treatment policy.\n\n\n\nAdditive and multiplicative shift MTP\nLet \\(A_t\\) denote a numeric vector.

(2024) demonstrated the use of modified treatment policies for survival outcomes to assess the effect of delaying invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) on mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City during the first COVID-19 wave. A synthetic version of the data used for that analysis has been loaded into R as intubation.\n\n\n\nStructure of data with survival outcome and time-varying treatment. Adapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\nThe data consists of \\(n = 2000\\) observations hospitalized with COVID-19 and who were followed for \\(\\tau = 14\\) days.\nThere are 10 baseline confounders and 4 time-varying confounders.\nThe outcome of interest is an indicator for death on day \\(t\\).\nObservations are subject to loss-to-follow-up due to either hospital discharge or transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs consider the following intervention\n\\[\n\\dd_t(a_t, h_t) = \\begin{cases}\n1 \\text{ if } a_t = 2 \\text{ and } a_s \\leq 1 \\forall s &lt; t \\\\\na_t \\text{ otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A_t\\) is a 3-level categorical variable: 0, no supplemental oxygen; 1, non-IMV supplemental oxygen support; 2, IMV.\nIn words, this function corresponds to an intervention where patients who were naturally observed as receiving IMV on day \\(t\\) instead had IMV delayed by a day to day \\(t+1\\).

Thus, some patients do need to be intubated and an intervention that eliminated intubation all together would be non-nonsensical.",

    "text": "Machine learning ensembles\nAs was already discussed, an attractive property of multiply-robust estimators is that they can incorporate flexible machine-learning algorithms for the estimation of nuisance parameters while remaining \\(\\sqrt{n}\\)-consistent.\n\nlmtp uses the super learner algorithm for estimating these nuisance parameters.\nThe super learner algorithm is an ensemble learner than incorporates a set of candidate models through a weighted convex-combination based on cross-validation. Asymptotically, this weighted combination of models, called the meta-learner, will outperform any single one of its components.\nlmtp uses the implementation of the super learner provided by the SuperLearner package.\nThe algorithms to be used in the super learner are specified with the learners_trt and learners_outcome arguments.\nThe outcome variable type should guide users on selecting the appropriate candidate learners for use with the learners_outcome argument.\nRegardless of whether an exposure is continuous, dichotomous, or categorical, the exposure mechanism is estimated using classification. Therefore only include candidate learners capable of binary classification with the learners_trt argument.\nCandidate learners that rely on cross-validation for the tuning of hyper-parameters should support grouped data if used with learners_trt. Because estimation of the treatment mechanism relies on the augmented \\(2n\\) duplicated data set, duplicated observations must be put into the same fold during sample-splitting. This is done automatically by the package.",

    "text": "Including in a manuscript\nIf you decide to use lmtp in your research, here‚Äôs a summary that can be included for explaining the methodology. It is based on the explanation in Rudolph et al. (2024):\nWe estimated the effect of [exposure] on [outcome], adjusting for covariates. This effect can be written: \\(\\E(Y^{\\dd, C=1} - Y^{C=1}),\\) [change the preceding to correspond to your effect] where \\(\\E(Y^{C=1})\\) [change as applicable] denotes the expected value of the counterfactual outcome had the exposure not been intervened on (i.e., remained as observed) and had no one been censored, and where \\(\\E(Y^{\\dd, C=1})\\) [change as applicable] denotes the expected value of the counterfactual outcome had the exposure been intervened on as dictated by the function \\(\\dd(A)\\) and had no one been censored. We defined \\(\\dd(A)\\) as a hypothetical intervention that increased the value of the exposure by 20% (i.e., multiplied each person‚Äôs value by 1.2). [change the preceding to correspond to your intervention, \\(\\dd\\)]\nThe above statistical estimand is a type of ``modified treatment policy‚Äô‚Äô (Haneuse and Rotnitzky (2013), Mu√±oz and Van Der Laan (2012), Young, Hern√°n, and Robins (2014), Dƒ±ÃÅaz et al. (2023)). The statistical estimand can be interpreted causally under the identifying assumptions of: 1) conditional exchangeability, meaning that there is no unobserved/unmeasured confounding of the relationship between the set of treatments and outcome conditional on covariates and that there is no unobserved/unmeasured confounding between censoring and the outcome conditional on the covariates and treatment; 2) positivity, and 3) consistency.\nWe estimated this statistical estimand using a doubly robust, nonparametric targeted minimum loss-based estimator (Dƒ±ÃÅaz et al. (2023), Williams and Dƒ±ÃÅaz (2023)). A cross-fitted version of this estimator was used with [fill in number]-folds. This estimator fits regressions for the outcome mechanism, treatment mechanism, and censoring mechanism. These regressions were fit using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms (van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard (2007)) consisting of [fill in the algorithms included in your superlearner library].\nYou can cite the package using the following BibTeX entries:\n@article{diaz2023nonparametric,\n  title={Nonparametric causal effects based on longitudinal modified treatment policies},\n  author={D{\\'\\i}az, Iv{\\'a}n and Williams, Nicholas and Hoffman, Katherine L and Schenck, Edward J},\n  journal={Journal of the American Statistical Association},\n  volume={118},\n  number={542},\n  pages={846--857},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={Taylor \\& Francis}\n}\n@article{williams2023lmtp,\n  title={lmtp: An {R} package for estimating the causal effects of modified treatment policies},\n  author={Williams, Nicholas and D{\\'\\i}az, Iv{\\'a}n},\n  journal={Observational Studies},\n  volume={9},\n  number={2},\n  pages={103--122},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={University of Pennsylvania Press}\n}\nYou can reference this workshop with:\n@inproceedings{lmtpSER,\n  author = {Williams, Nicholas and D{\\'\\i}az, Iv{\\'a}n and Rudolph, Kara E},\n  title = {Beyond the Average Treatment Effect},\n  booktitle = {Society for Epidemiologic Research Conference},\n  year = {2024},\n  address = {Austin, TX},\n  month = {June},\n  organization = {Society for Epidemiologic Research},\n  note = {Additional Note},\n  url = {https://nt-williams.github.io/lmtp-workshop/}\n}",

We will assume that the data are generated by the following causal model (but alternative definitions can be achieved using other causal models):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL &= f_L(U_L)\\\\\nA &= f_A(L, U_A)\\\\\nY &= f_Y(A, L, U_Y)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThe functions \\(f\\) are assumed fixed, but likely unknown.\n\\(U = (U_L, U_A, U_Y)\\) is a vector of exogenous, unmeasured random variables.\nThis system is referred to as a Non-parametric Structural Equation Model (NPSEM).\nWe will assume that this system of equations exists in nature and is responsible for generating our observed data.\n\n\nWe will often refer to \\(L\\) as confounders, \\(A\\) as the treatment or exposure, and \\(Y\\) as the outcome.\n\nTake for example the following sample of data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet, \\(L\\) = sex, bmi, age, and smoke; \\(A\\) = trt; and \\(Y\\) = event. When we say that we assume the previous NPSEM, we are positing that:\n\nthe variable trt was generated from an unknown function of the random variables sex, bmi, age, and smoke, as well as a set of unmeasured random variables not present in our data.\nthat the variable event was generated from an unknown function of the variables that generated trt in addition to trt itself.\n\nNote that in some cases, we may know one or more of the functions \\(f\\). For example, if our data came from a randomized clinical trial for \\(A\\), then we know the function \\(f_A\\).\nCentral to how we will define causal effects is the concept of counterfactual random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìö Counterfactual random variables: Hypothetical random variables that would have been observed, possibly contrary to fact, in an alternative world.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where we are interested in the value of \\(Y\\) in a hypothetical situation where, instead of the variable \\(A\\) being equal to its observed value, \\(A\\) is set to some other value.\n\nThe value of \\(Y\\) in this hypothetical situation is a counterfactual random variable.\nlet \\(\\dd(A, L)\\) be a function that takes a treatment value \\(A\\) and a covariate profile \\(L\\) and returns a new value of treatment. We will refer to the function \\(\\dd\\) as a shift function or a general hypothetical intervention.\nDenote the value of \\(Y\\) in the hypothetical world where treatment is set to the value \\(\\dd(A,L)\\) as \\(Y^{\\dd}\\).\n\nReturning to the data example, imagine we are interested in the value of event if trt was replaced with the output of a function \\(\\dd\\) that always returns 1:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL &= f_L(U_L)\\\\\nA^{\\dd} &= \\dd(A, L) = 1 \\\\\nY^{\\dd} &= f_Y(1, L, U_Y)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nHere we introduce some new notation \\(A^{\\dd}\\) to refer to the post-intervention exposure. If we had the ability to collect data from this alternative NPSEM, the data may instead look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we are never able to collect data from this alternative world. This is called the fundamental problem of causal inference.\n\nThe previous NPSEM is the simplest causal model we will assume in this workshop. However, real data is often much more complex and may be characterized by:\n\ntime-varying variables\nloss-to-follow-up\n\nAs such, we need to modify and introduce some additional notation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\)\nThe index (i.e.¬†a row in a dataset) of an observation from a data set with \\(n\\) total units (i.e., the total number of rows)\n\n\n\\(t\\)\nThe index of time for a total number of time points \\(\\tau\\)\n\n\n\\(L_t\\)\nConfounders at time \\(t\\)\n\n\n\\(A_t\\)\nA vector of intervention variables (i..e, treatment or exposure) at time \\(t\\)\n\n\n\\(Y\\)\nAn outcome variable observed at the end of the study, that is at time \\(\\tau + 1\\).

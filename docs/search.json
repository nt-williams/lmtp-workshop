(Most papers we read assume this!!) While assuming exposure variables are binary can simplify the definition of causal effects, many exposures of interest in reality are not binary.\nInstead, we will work in situations where \\(A\\) is a binary, categorical, multivariate, or continuous variable!\nIn the previous section, we defined \\(\\dd(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon_t)\\) as a function that maps \\(A_t\\), \\(H_t\\), and potentially a randomizer \\(\\epsilon_t\\) to a new value of \\(A_t\\). Our focus henceforth is estimating the causal effect of an intervention, characterized by \\(\\dd\\) on the outcome \\(Y\\), through the causal parameter\n\\[\n\\theta = \\E[Y^{\\bar A^{\\dd}}]\\text{,}\n\\]\nwhere \\(Y^{\\bar A^{\\dd}}\\) is the counterfactual outcome in a world, where possibly contrary to fact, each entry of \\(\\bar{A} = (A_1, \\ldots, A_\\tau)\\) was modified according to the function \\(\\dd\\).\nBut what is this function \\(\\dd\\), how can it be defined, and how does using this function to define interventions solve the problem? Let’s start from simple to more complex examples of functions \\(\\dd\\).",

    "text": "Modified Treatment Policies\nWhile much attention is given to static and dynamic interventions, their use is often accompanied by a few key problems.\n\nDefining causal effects in terms of hypothetical interventions where treatment is applied to all units may be inconceivable. For example, we may be interested to know if reducing surgery time reduces surgical complications. However, it’s inconceivable to set all surgeries to a given duration, even if this duration depends on patient covariates.\nDefining causal effects in terms of hypothetical interventions where treatment is applied to all units may induce positivity violations.\n\nA solution to these problems is to instead define causal effects using modified treatment policies (MTP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intervention characterized by a hypothetical world where the natural value of treatment is modified is called a modified treatment policy.\n\n\n\n\nAdditive and multiplicative shift MTP\nLet \\(A_t\\) denote a numeric vector. Assume that \\(A_t\\) has support in the data such that \\(P(A_t \\leq u(h_t) \\mid H_t = h_t) = 1\\).

This MTP is referred to as an additive shift MTP.\n\nExample\n\nDı́az et al. (2023) estimated the effect of increasing P/F ratio (a measure of hypoxemia) by 50 units on survival among those patients with acute respiratory failure (a P/F ratio &lt; 300). \\[\n\\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon) = \\begin{cases}\na_t + 50 &\\text{ if } a_t \\leq 300 \\\\\na_t &\\text{ otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nWe can similarly define a multiplicative shift MTP as\n\\[\n\\dd(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon) = \\begin{cases}\na_t \\times \\delta &\\text{ if } a_t \\times \\delta \\leq u(h_t) \\\\\na_t &\\text{ otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nExample\n\nNugent and Balzer (2023) evaluated the association between county-level measures of mobility and incident COVID-19 cases in the United States in the Summer and Fall of 2022.

Thus, some patients do need to be intubated and an intervention that eliminated intubation all together would be non-nonsensical.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now estimate the effect of delaying intubation by 1-day on 14-day mortality.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

As we already discussed, however, the validity of these methods requires making unrealistic parametric assumptions.\nThe ltmle and survtmle packages implement a doubly-robust method for estimating causal effects from longitudinal data, but these packages do not support continuous valued exposures, multiple exposures, interventions that depend on the natural value of the exposure, or stochastic interventions.\n\nIn contrast, the lmtp package (software companion to the paper by Dı́az et al.

Data may be either a data.frame or tibble but not a data.table.\nColumns do not have to be in any specific order and the data may contain variables that are not used in estimation.\nThe names of treatment variables are specified with the trt argument.\nThe names of censoring variables are specified with the cens argument.\nThe names of baseline covariates are specified with the baseline argument.\nThe names of time-varying covariates are specified with the time_vary argument.\nThe trt argument accepts either a character vector or a list of character vectors.\nThe cens and baseline arguments accept character vectors.\nThe time_vary argument accepts a list of character vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors and lists are basic data structures in R. A vector can be thought of as a 1-dimensional collection of homogeneous elements. For example a character vector is a collection of values with the class character.\n\n\na_character_vector &lt;- c(\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"character\", \"vector\")\n\nA list is similar, except that it can hold elements of different types.\n\n\na_list &lt;- list(\n  a_character_vector = c(\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"character\", \"vector\"), \n  a_numeric_vector = 1:10, \n  a_list_whithin_a_list = list(1, 2, 3, 4)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trt, cens, and time_vary arguments must be sorted according to the time-ordering of the model with each index containing the name (or names) of variables for the given time.\nThe outcome variable is specified with the outcome argument.\nThe outcome_type argument specifies the type of outcome. It should be set to \"continuous\" for continuous outcomes, \"binomial\" for dichotomous outcomes, and \"survival\" for time-to–event outcomes.\nCensoring indicators should be coded using 0 and 1 where 1 indicates an observation is observed at the next time and 0 indicates loss-to-follow-up. Once an observation’s censoring status is switched to 0 it cannot change back to 1. Missing data before an observation is censored is not allowed.\nThe argument should be set to for continuous outcomes, for dichotomous outcomes, and for time-to-event outcomes.\n\n\n\nData structure examples\n\nPoint treatment\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nPoint-treatment with censoring\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nTime-varying treatment with censoring\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nPoint-treatment with survival outcome\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nTime-varying treatment with survival outcome\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning ensembles\nAs was already discussed, an attractive property of multiply-robust estimators is that they can incorporate flexible machine-learning algorithms for the estimation of nuisance parameters while remaining \\(\\sqrt{n}\\)-consistent.\n\nlmtp uses the super learner algorithm for estimating these nuisance parameters.\nThe super learner algorithm is an ensemble learner than incorporates a set of candidate models through a weighted convex-combination based on cross-validation. Asymptotically, this weighted combination of models, called the meta-learner, will outperform any single one of its components.\nlmtp uses the implementation of the super learner provided by the SuperLearner package.\nThe algorithms to be used in the super learner are specified with the learners_trt and learners_outcome arguments.\nThe outcome variable type should guide users on selecting the appropriate candidate learners for use with the learners_outcome argument.\nRegardless of whether an exposure is continuous, dichotomous, or categorical, the exposure mechanism is estimated using classification. Therefore only include candidate learners capable of binary classification with the learners_trt argument.\nCandidate learners that rely on cross-validation for the tuning of hyper-parameters should support grouped data if used with learners_trt. Because estimation of the treatment mechanism relies on the augmented \\(2n\\) duplicated data set, duplicated observations must be put into the same fold during sample-splitting.

This short course will introduce the lmtp R package for estimating the causal effects of these general estimand in both point-treatment and longitudinal studies.

    "text": "Including in a manuscript\nIf you decide to use lmtp in your research, here’s a summary that can be included for explaining the methodology. It is based on the explanation in Rudolph et al. (2024):\n\nWe estimated the effect of [exposure] on [outcome], adjusting for covariates. This effect can be written: \\(\\E(Y^{\\dd, C=1} - Y^{C=1}),\\) [change the preceding to correspond to your effect] where \\(\\E(Y^{C=1})\\) [change as applicable] denotes the expected value of the counterfactual outcome had the exposure not been intervened on (i.e., remained as observed) and had no one been censored, and where \\(\\E(Y^{\\dd, C=1})\\) [change as applicable] denotes the expected value of the counterfactual outcome had the exposure been intervened on as dictated by the function \\(\\dd(A)\\) and had no one been censored. We defined \\(\\dd(A)\\) as a hypothetical intervention that increased the value of the exposure by 20% (i.e., multiplied each person’s value by 1.2). [change the preceding to correspond to your intervention, \\(\\dd\\)]\nThe above statistical estimand is a type of ``modified treatment policy’’ (Haneuse and Rotnitzky (2013), Muñoz and Van Der Laan (2012), Young, Hernán, and Robins (2014), Dı́az et al. (2023)). The statistical estimand can be interpreted causally under the identifying assumptions of: 1) conditional exchangeability, meaning that there is no unobserved/unmeasured confounding of the relationship between the set of treatments and outcome conditional on covariates and that there is no unobserved/unmeasured confounding between censoring and the outcome conditional on the covariates and treatment; 2) positivity, and 3) consistency.\nWe estimated this statistical estimand using a doubly robust, nonparametric targeted minimum loss-based estimator (Dı́az et al. (2023), Williams and Dı́az (2023)). A cross-fitted version of this estimator was used with [fill in number]-folds. This estimator fits regressions for the outcome mechanism, treatment mechanism, and censoring mechanism. These regressions were fit using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms (van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard (2007)) consisting of [fill in the algorithms included in your superlearner library].\n\nYou can cite the package using the following BibTeX entries:\n@article{diaz2023nonparametric,\n  title={Nonparametric causal effects based on longitudinal modified treatment policies},\n  author={D{\\'\\i}az, Iv{\\'a}n and Williams, Nicholas and Hoffman, Katherine L and Schenck, Edward J},\n  journal={Journal of the American Statistical Association},\n  volume={118},\n  number={542},\n  pages={846--857},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={Taylor \\& Francis}\n}\n@article{williams2023lmtp,\n  title={lmtp: An {R} package for estimating the causal effects of modified treatment policies},\n  author={Williams, Nicholas and D{\\'\\i}az, Iv{\\'a}n},\n  journal={Observational Studies},\n  volume={9},\n  number={2},\n  pages={103--122},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={University of Pennsylvania Press}\n}\nYou can reference this workshop with:\n@inproceedings{lmtpSER,\n  author = {Williams, Nicholas and D{\\'\\i}az, Iv{\\'a}n and Rudolph, Kara E},\n  title = {Beyond the Average Treatment Effect},\n  booktitle = {&lt;Insert conference&gt;},\n  year = {&lt;Insert year of confernece&gt;},\n  address = {&lt;Insert conference location&gt;},\n  month = {&lt;Insert conference month&gt;},\n  organization = {&lt;Insert conference organizer&gt;},\n  url = {https://www.beyondtheate.com}\n}",

## Including in a manuscript

If you decide to use `lmtp` in your research, here's a summary that can be included for explaining the methodology. It is based on the explanation in @rudolph2024associations:

> We estimated the effect of \[exposure\] on \[outcome\], adjusting for covariates. This effect can be written: $\E(Y^{\dd, C=1} - Y^{C=1}),$ \[change the preceding to correspond to your effect\] where $\E(Y^{C=1})$ \[change as applicable\] denotes the expected value of the counterfactual outcome had the exposure not been intervened on (i.e., remained as observed) and had no one been censored, and where $\E(Y^{\dd, C=1})$ \[change as applicable\] denotes the expected value of the counterfactual outcome had the exposure been intervened on as dictated by the function $\dd(A)$ and had no one been censored. We defined $\dd(A)$ as a hypothetical intervention that increased the value of the exposure by 20% (i.e., multiplied each person's value by 1.2). \[change the preceding to correspond to your intervention, $\dd$\]
>
> The above statistical estimand is a type of \`\`modified treatment policy'' (@haneuse2013estimation, @munoz2012population, @young2014identification, @diaz2023nonparametric). The statistical estimand can be interpreted causally under the identifying assumptions of: 1) conditional exchangeability, meaning that there is no unobserved/unmeasured confounding of the relationship between the set of treatments and outcome conditional on covariates and that there is no unobserved/unmeasured confounding between censoring and the outcome conditional on the covariates and treatment; 2) positivity, and 3) consistency.
> 
We estimated this statistical estimand using a doubly robust, nonparametric targeted minimum loss-based estimator (@diaz2023nonparametric, @williams2023lmtp). A cross-fitted version of this estimator was used with \[fill in number\]-folds. This estimator fits regressions for the outcome mechanism, treatment mechanism, and censoring mechanism. These regressions were fit using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms (@vanderLaanPolleyHubbard07) consisting of \[fill in the algorithms included in your superlearner library\].

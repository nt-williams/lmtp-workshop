### [Iván Díaz](https://www.idiaz.xyz/)

Iván is an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. His research focuses on the development of non-parametric statistical methods for causal inference from observational and randomized studies with complex datasets, using machine learning. This includes but is not limited to mediation analysis, methods for continuous exposures, longitudinal data including survival analysis, and efficiency guarantees with covariate adjustment in randomized trials. He also works applying these methods to healthcare research, including in neurology, critical care, opioid use research, and other areas.

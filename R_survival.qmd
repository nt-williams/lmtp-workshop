### Data considerations

-   Similar to when the outcome is binary, survival outcomes should be coded using 0's and 1's where 1 indicates the occurrence of an event and 0 otherwise.

-   Similar to how we encode censoring variables, we consider the outcome to be degenerate. Meaning that once an observation experiences an outcome, all future outcome variables should also be coded with a 1 ("last-observation-carried-forward").

### Point-treatment survival problems

Up to this point, we've been ignoring that the `covid` dataset should be treated as a point-treatment survival problem. Let's re-estimate the effect of the randomized treatment with a survival framework.

-   We need to transform the data from long to wide format

-   and impute the outcome using last-observation-carried-forward.

Our modified dataset should look like this:

![Structure of data with survival outcome and point-treatment. Adapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.](images/data_survival.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

```{webr-r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

covid <- pivot_wider(
  covid, 
  values_from = "event", 
  names_from = "days", 
  names_prefix = "day_", 
  names_sort = TRUE
)

covid <- 
  event_locf(covid, paste0("day_", 1:15)) |> 
  mutate(across(starts_with("day_"), ~ replace_na(.x, 0))) |> 
  as.data.frame()

head(covid)
```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Use the function `event_locf()` to make sure the outcome variables are correctly recorded.
:::

-   Instead of just estimating the effect of treatment on the outcome at the last time point, we can estimate the effect of a treatment on an outcome at all follow-up intervals.

Let's estimate the effect of the treatment on intubation at each day. To do so, we can use the function `lmtp_survival()` .

```{webr-r}
W <- c("age", "sex", "bmi", "smoke", "o2", 
       "num_comorbid", "num_symptoms", "bilat", "dyspnea", "hyper")

fit <- lmtp_survival(
  data = covid, 
  trt = "A", 
  outcomes = grep("^day", names(covid), value = TRUE),
  baseline = W, 
  shift = static_binary_on, 
  folds = 1, 
  estimator = "lmtp_sdr", 
  control = lmtp_control(.learners_outcome_folds = 2, 
                         .learners_trt_folds = 2)
)
```

We can now visualize our results using a survival plot.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
The main result of an `lmtp` object can be extracted using the `tidy()` function from the `broom` package.
:::

```{webr-r}
library(ggplot2)

results <- tidy(fit)

ggplot(results, aes(x = t, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_step() + 
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Survival probability") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.65, 1), 
                     n.breaks = 10, 
                     expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 15), 
                     n.breaks = 15, 
                     expand = c(0.01, 0))
```

### Time-varying treatment

@hoffman2023introducing demonstrated the use of modified treatment policies for survival outcomes to assess the effect of delaying invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) on mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City during the first COVID-19 wave. A synthetic version of the data used for that analysis has been loaded into R as `intubation`.

![Structure of data with survival outcome and time-varying treatment. Adapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.](images/data_complex.png){fig-align="center"}

-   The data consists of $n = 2000$ observations hospitalized with COVID-19 and who were followed for $\tau = 14$ days.

-   There are 10 baseline confounders and 4 time-varying confounders.

-   The outcome of interest is an indicator for death on day $t$.

-   Observations are subject to loss-to-follow-up due to either hospital discharge or transfer.

```{r echo=FALSE}
intubation <- read.csv("data/hoffman_toy.csv")
DT::datatable(intubation) |> 
  DT::formatRound(columns = "age", digits = 0)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's consider the following intervention

$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t) = \begin{cases}
1 \text{ if } a_t = 2 \text{ and } a_s \leq 1 \forall s < t \\
a_t \text{ otherwise},
\end{cases}
$$

where $A_t$ is a 3-level categorical variable: 0, no supplemental oxygen; 1, non-IMV supplemental oxygen support; 2, IMV.

In words, this function corresponds to an intervention where patients who were naturally observed as receiving IMV on day $t$ instead had IMV delayed by a day to day $t+1$. Let's translate this policy to an R function that we can use with `lmtp`.

```{webr-r}
d <- function(data, trt) {
  # If it's the first time point and intubated, set to 1
  if (trt == "I_00") {
    a_d <- ifelse(data$I_00 == "2", 
                  factor("1", levels = 0:2), 
                  data$I_00)
    return(a_d)
  }
  # extract time point
  tau <- as.numeric(gsub("[^\\d]+", "", trt, perl = TRUE))
  # get the name of previous trt column
  trt_prev <- paste0("I_", sprintf("%02d", tau - 1))       
  
  # If intubated at time T but not T-1, set to 1
  ifelse(data[[trt]] == "2" & data[[trt_prev]] != "2", 
         factor("1", levels = 0:2), 
         data[[trt]])
}
```

We can now estimate the effect of delaying intubation by 1-day on 14-day mortality.

```{webr-r}
#| results: 'asis'
day <- 14
A <- paste0("I_", sprintf("%02d", 0:(day - 1)))
W <- names(intubation)[1:10]
Y <- paste0("Y_", sprintf("%02d", 1:day))
Obs <- paste0("C_", sprintf("%02d", 0:(day - 1)))
L <- grep("^L_", names(intubation), value = TRUE)
L <- lapply(0:(day - 1), \(x) L[grepl(sprintf("%02d", x), L)])

lmtp_sdr(
  intubation,
  trt = A,
  outcome = Y,
  baseline = W,
  time_vary = L,
  cens = Obs,
  shift = d, 
  mtp = TRUE,
  outcome_type = "survival",
  folds = 1,
  k = 2
)
```

### Problem 1

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## Question

Why might defining an intervention in terms of an MTP instead of a static intervention be more useful to answer a question about the effect of IMV on death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19?

Answer

</summary>

<p>Intubation may increase the likelihood of mortality through factors separate from COVID (by increasing the likelihood of AKI, for example); however, not intubating a patient who is in respiratory distress may also increase the likelihood of mortality. Thus, some patients do need to be intubated and an intervention that eliminated intubation all together would be non-nonsensical.</p>

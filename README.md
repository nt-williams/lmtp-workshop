## **Beyond the ATE: Estimating the causal effects of binary, categorical, continuous, and multivariate exposures in R**

Nick Williams, Kara Rudolph, and Iván Díaz

## [LMTP](https://github.com/nt-williams/lmtp) Workshop for [SER 2024](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2024-meeting/)

> Modified treatment policies (MTPs) are a class of interventions that
> generalize static and dynamic interventions for categorical,
> continuous, and multivariate exposures. MTPs are hypothetical
> interventions where the post-intervention is defined as a modification
> of the natural value of the exposure that can depend on the unit’s
> history. This short course will introduce the lmtp R package for
> estimating the causal effects of MTPs in both point-treatment and
> longitudinal studies. We will discuss identification of MTPs,
> estimation with a targeted minimum-loss based estimator and a
> sequentially doubly-robust estimator, and provide guidance on
> estimator choice.
>
> We will walk participants through applying these methods in point
> treatment and longitudinal settings and for each of the following
> treatment types: 1) static interventions (e.g., in estimating the
> ATE), 2) dynamic interventions, 3) continuous exposures, and 3)
> multivariate exposures.

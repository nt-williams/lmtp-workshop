## Notation

Consider a typical setting where we have measured some treatment $A$, some set of pre-treatment variables $L$, and an outcome $Y$. We will assume that the data are generated by the following causal model (but alternative definitions can be achieved using other causal models):

$$
\begin{align}
L &= f_L(U_L)\\
A &= f_A(L, U_A)\\
Y &= f_Y(A, L, U_Y)
\end{align}
$$

-   The functions $f$ are assumed fixed, but likely unknown.

-   $U = (U_L, U_A, U_Y)$ is a vector of exogenous, unmeasured random variables.

-   This system is referred to as a Non-parametric Structural Equation Model (NPSEM).

-   We will assume that this system of equations exists in nature and is responsible for generating our observed data.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
We will often refer to $L$ as confounders, $A$ as the treatment or exposure, and $Y$ as the outcome.

Take for example the following sample of data:

```{r echo=FALSE}
read.csv("data/williams_synthetic.csv") |>
  dplyr::select(sex, bmi, age, smoke, trt = A, event) |> 
  dplyr::sample_n(10) |> 
  DT::datatable(class = "compact", 
                options = list(
                  searching = FALSE, 
                  lengthChange = FALSE, 
                  ordering = FALSE, 
                  info = FALSE, 
                  columnDefs = list(
                    list(targets = 0, visible = FALSE),
                    list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all")  # apply to all columns
                  )
                )) |> 
  DT::formatRound(columns = "age", digits = 0)
```

\
Let, $L$ = `sex`, `bmi`, `age`, and `smoke`; $A$ = `trt`; and $Y$ = `event`. When we say that we assume the previous NPSEM, we are positing that:

-   the variable `trt` was generated from an unknown function of the random variables `sex`, `bmi`, `age`, and `smoke`, as well as a set of unmeasured random variables not present in our data.

-   that the variable `event` was generated from an unknown function of the variables that generated `trt` in addition to `trt` itself.

Note that in some cases, we may know one or more of the functions $f$. For example, if our data came from a randomized trial for $A$, then we know the function $f_A$.

## Counterfactuals

Central to how we will define causal effects is the concept of *counterfactual random variables.*

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Counterfactuals are random variables that would have been observed, possibly contrary to fact, in an alternative world.
:::

For example, consider a scenario where we are interested in the value of $Y$ in a hypothetical situation where, instead of the variable $A$ being equal to its observed value, it is set to some other value $A^\dd$.

-   The value of $Y$ in this hypothetical situation is a counterfactual random variable.

Typically, one is interested in counterfactuals where treatment is set to some deterministic value. For instance, one could be interested in setting treatment $A^\dd=1$. One could also be interested in setting $A$ according to some covariates, e.g., "treat if age > 50".

- This intervention would be denoted as $A^\dd=\dd(L)$ for some function  $\dd$, and is known as a dynamic treatment regime.

In this workshop we are interested in a generalization of this concept, where the function $\dd$ can also depend on the *natural value of treatment* $A$:

-   Let $\dd(A, L)$ be a function that takes a natural treatment value $A$ and a covariate profile $L$ and returns a new value of treatment. **We will refer to the function** $\dd$ **as a *shift* function or a *general hypothetical intervention*.**

-   Denote the value of $Y$ in the hypothetical world where treatment is set to the value $\dd(A,L)$ as $Y^{\dd}$.

Returning to the data example, imagine we are interested in the value of `event` if `trt` was replaced with the output of a function $\dd$ that always returns 1:

$$
\begin{align}
L &= f_L(U_L)\\
A^{\dd} &= \dd(A, L) = 1 \\
Y^{\dd} &= f_Y(1, L, U_Y)
\end{align}
$$

Here we introduce some new notation $A^{\dd}$ to refer to the post-intervention exposure. If we had the ability to collect data from this alternative NPSEM, the data may instead look like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
read.csv("data/williams_synthetic.csv") |>
  dplyr::select(sex, bmi, age, smoke, trt = A, event) |> 
  dplyr::slice(1:10) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(trt = 1, event = 0) |> 
  DT::datatable(class = "compact", 
                options = list(
                  searching = FALSE, 
                  lengthChange = FALSE, 
                  ordering = FALSE, 
                  info = FALSE, 
                  columnDefs = list(
                    list(targets = 0, visible = FALSE),
                    list(className = 'dt-left', targets = "_all")  # apply to all columns
                  )
                )) |> 
  DT::formatRound(columns = "age", digits = 0)
```
\
**Unfortunately, we are never able to collect data from this alternative world. This is called the fundamental problem of causal inference.**

The previous NPSEM is the simplest causal model we will assume in this workshop. However, real data is often much more complex and may be characterized by:

-   time-varying variables

-   loss-to-follow-up

As such, we need to modify and introudce some additional notation:
